							<p>
								I have self-taught myself Unreal Engine, and have used it to implement game environments, create 3D models and animations for small-scale projects. Building on my experience as a top-performing artist, I have evolved into a creative designer.

							I started with Unity and got to know Unreal Engine. Through the iClone, I studied the production of Metahumans and animation. So far, I have been studying steadily through Google searches and Epic learning. My experience as a performing artist and growing up in an environment where I encountered various arts will be a stepping stone for me to grow into a good digital creative director.

											I participated in the MaummoM Project, which is an interpretation of the Jeju Shamanistic Gut ritual, Nol-e-gut, as a healing and recovery performance. It featured flow art using fire, movements of the mind and body by MaummoM, performers, and drone control with the EMOTIV epoc+ EEG system to experiment with physical movement through the power of the mind.

						<p>
							From 2018 to the present day (2023), I have been working as a choreographer and media artist for the Korean traditional arts group Maro and the media art team Inspire.
						<p>
							In 2016, I presented a performance piece titled "The Dance Speaks" at the Seoul Arts Center. Through this work, I explored the original movements that had been forgotten in Jeju, and reinterpreted the movements of craftsmanship and shamanism through dance.
						<p>
							In 2014, I gained experience by participating in "The Dance Speaks" by the National Contemporary Dance Company. That same year, I moved to Jeju and operated the Maummom Studio while working as a guest dancer for the Jeju Provincial Dance Company.
						<p>
							In 2010, through my involvement with Platoon Kunsthalle Seoul, I encountered various experimental and multidisciplinary art forms and collaborated with international artists. This led me to the world of media art through the combination of movement and various forms of art.
						<p>
							In 2008, I was a guest performer in a contemporary dance performance in Frankfurt, Germany. After this experience, I enrolled in the Korean National University of Arts to broaden my knowledge of performing arts.
						<p>
							In 2006, I co-founded House Rules Rule, which became a well-known brand for parties, music, and dance. Following this, I engaged in various activities, including appearances on music shows such as Immortal Songs. In 2008, I won the Mnet Rookie Singer Award.
						<p>
							I began street dancing as a high school student in 1999 and created a unique flow in places like Gangnam and Hongdae, generating a significant impact.
